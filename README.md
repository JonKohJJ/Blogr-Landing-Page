# Blogr-Landing-Page

Live Site - https://jonkohjj.github.io/Blogr-Landing-Page/

I built this website using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. Again, I made this website responsive taking into consideration mobile, table and desktop users. The design was taken from frontendmentor.io and then built from scratch.

Concepts learnt - 
1. Drop down menu (display: block)
2. Working with images/svgs
3. Negative margins
